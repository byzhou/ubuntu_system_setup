\textit{Hardware Trojan Detection through Golden Chip-Free Statistical Side-Channel Fingerprinting}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Utilize the Process Control Monitors} The monitors exists on the area
                        in-between die or on the die for process characterization.
                \item \textit{Non-linear Regression Models} The way to learn side-channel fingerprints
                        using Monte-Carlo simulation.
                \item \textit{Tail Modeling Methods} Enhance classification boundary.
                \item \textit{Critics} Use math models to enhance detection rate but without any 
                        real chips.
                \item \textit{main idea} Establish a systematic way to build up a multi-dimension
                        space area, where it is very easy to define a hyper-space region, which you
                        can tell which point is trojan free. All the axes are the side-channel factors.
                \item \textbf{our work concern} The HTs are added by reverse engineering. The problem 
                        is that if we add antennas, they will be discovered in the reverse engineered
                        part. And they are easily modified by adding those antenna cells.

            \end{itemize}

\textit{something about running cadence}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{run in command line is the best} Not only the gui will bring you a lot
                        of trouble but also it can cause failure.
                \item \textit{export gds in encounter} streamout yourFileName.gds
                \item \textit{import gds file in virtuoso} strmin -library AES\_trojan -strmFile /your
                        /path/of/the/gds/file/file.gds

\textit{A novel RF fingerprinting approach for hardware integrated security}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{main idea} The idea is to use RF fingerprint as a PUF. The RF response is 
                        unique with their signature. The extraction of the fingerprint is based on the 
                        scattered near-fields S-parameters.
                \item \textit{SIM} Subscriber Identity Module.
                \item \textit{PUF} The real PUF is in the purely-randomized distribution of particles
                        within the poly-styrene filling.
                \item \textit{method} They sweep over 20,000 points chosen for measurements, using 
                        $frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ combinations.
       		\end{itemize}

\textit{PSR Enhancement Through Super Gain Boosting and Differential Feed-Forward Noise Cancellation
        a 65-nm CMOS LDO Regulator}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{PSF} Power supply regection, is a term that is used to describe the fluctuations
                        in the input of the power supply's affection towards the outputs. 
                \item \textit{SGA} Super Gain Amplifier.
                \item \textit{ADC} ADC is a very noise-sensetive circuit.
                \item \textit{LDO small gain} The small loop gain of the LDO regulator produces a large steady-
                        state error at dc in its output.
                \item \textit{why analog circuit can not scale} Due to the short gate channel length, the output
                        resistance is too small and corresponding $V_{E}$ is also small.
                \item \textit{several ways to improve the gain with limited length} 
                        \begin{itemize}
                            \item \textit{multi-stages} This is limited by compensation problem.\textbf{I don't 
                                understand what compensation problem is. }
                            \item \textit{positive feedback}
                        \end{itemize}
                \item \textit{SGA} SGA is pretty interesting, worth designing sometimes.
                \item \textit{PFCM} Positive Feedback Current Mirror \textbf{interesting part}
            \end{itemize}

\textit{A FVF LDO Regulator With Dual-Summed Miller Frequency Compensation for Wide Load Capacitance 
        Range Applications}
\indent		\begin{itemize}
                \item \textit{Miller Effect} Miller effect accounts for increase the input cap due to cap between
                        input to the output.
                        \begin{equation}
                            C_{M}=C(1+A_{v})
                        \end{equation}
                        where $A_{v}$ is the gain of the amp. It will reduce the bandwidth of the amp and restrict
                        the range of operation to tlower freqs.
