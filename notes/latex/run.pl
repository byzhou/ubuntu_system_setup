Usage: It is used for observing the latex notes. Th series of commands will handl the notes into a 
       nice repo. It provides me a great opportunity to learn this language perl.

    [-c] (target.tex) Compile the targe tex file into current folder. If file needs to be putted 
        into a specific folder, more parameters needs to be specified.
        Example:
            ./run.pl -c Using the default file to compile.
            ./run.pl -c ../latex/week1_fall.tex Using the file at that place.
        The pdflatex compilation log will be saved in the last_fun.log file in the same dir.
    [-h] This is the help text.
        or call [--help], or call [-help]
    [-p] Push all the tex file to github.
    [-rm] All the unncessary files will be moved.
    [-v] Similar to -c but -v is the command that shows the pdf file after the compilation.
    [-l] List all the tex files.
